# Network Engineering Projects

Welcome to the "Network Engineering Projects" GitHub repository, a comprehensive and evolving hub for network projects primarily centered around Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository is more than just a collection of projects; it's a documented journey through the intricate and fascinating world of network engineering.

## About This Repository

As a current learner and future expert in network engineering, I've created this repository as a living diary of my progress and a resource for fellow learners. Starting with foundational network engineering projects, this repository is my commitment to not just learning but also sharing knowledge in the realm of network engineering.

### Current Focus: Foundational Network Engineering

The foundational stage of network engineering is where this journey begins. The projects you'll find here are tailored to those beginning their path in network engineering or looking to solidify their foundational knowledge. These projects cover a range of topics including, but not limited to:

- Basic network configuration
- Routing and switching
- VLANs
- Network security basics
- Troubleshooting network issues

Each project is crafted in Cisco Packet Tracer, a versatile and accessible platform for network simulation.

### Future Aspirations: Advanced Network Engineering

While the current focus lies in foundational network engineering, the vision of this repository extends far beyond. As I progress in my learning journey, I aim to dive into more advanced topics. This means the repository will grow in complexity and depth, offering a richer learning experience over time.

## Getting Involved

Your contributions, feedback, and questions are what make this journey meaningful. Feel free to fork the repository, suggest changes, or reach out if you have queries or ideas for collaboration.

Let's embark on this journey of growth and discovery in network engineering together!
